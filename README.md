**Intro**

This Around the U.S. webpage is an ongoing project in the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. The project uses HTML and CSS to create a responsive design so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices based on a Figma design. The project also uses JavaScript to add user functionality to the page, including pop-up modals where users can edit profile information and add cards according to validation requirements, as well as preview card images, and like or delete cards.
